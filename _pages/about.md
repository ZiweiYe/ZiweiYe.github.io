I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development, Renmin University of China. I work broadly at the intersection of food, the environment and public health, with a particular emphasis on crop technology. My past work has comprehensively evaluated the social welfare consequences of restricting glyphosate (a dominant herbicide) use in corn production by weighing its environmental and human health welfare gain against economic loss in a monetary framework. My current research focuses on climate and sustainability issues: (1) the adaptive value of drought-tolerance (DT) technology to compensate for climate change impacts and the moral hazard in DT adoption, and (2) the sustainable use of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) crops to preserve pest susceptibility as a common pool resource.    

I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Economics and Management from Zhejiang University in 2017, and ontained my Ph.D. in Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics from Michigan State University in 2022, under the supervision of Drs. Felicia Wu and David A. Hennessy. During my Ph.D., I have also worked as a consultant in the Development Research Group, the World Bank, conducting policy analysis in developing countries.
